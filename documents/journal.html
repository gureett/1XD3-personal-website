                        Currently, I have been quite happy with this course, I like the way I have made my personal website as I like the minimal aesthetic. I definetely need to put more work in to finish all the parts, hopefully I will get to that next week. I feel quite comfortable designing and working with web pages, and I can't wait to see what we learn after this unit!
